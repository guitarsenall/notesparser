# notesparser
Convert a notes text file (in my unique format) into HTML with hyperlinks to images.

For full development notes, See 
    ..\data\notes.txt

Run at command line via
    D:\...\notesparser> python markup.py < test_input.txt > test_output.html

Still need to update python path to find the code from another folder.
