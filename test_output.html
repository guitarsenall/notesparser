+   Objective: A Python tool to convert my analysis-notes text files into
    HTML files with hyperlinks to images in the same folder as the
    notes file.

<p>
*   Base this off the "Instant Markup" project in chapter 20 of
        "Beginning Python" (Magnus Lie Hetland, 2nd edition).
                see beginning_python_cover_a.jpg
        -   The source code is available at
                    <a href="http://www.apress.com">http://www.apress.com</a>
            >   It offers the choice to "Use Git or checkout with SVN using
                the web URL."
                    https://github.com/Apress/beg-python.git
                I REALLY need to get moving with GIT!
            >   For now, download the ZIP. The code I want is in
                    D:\Users\Owner\Documents\OneDrive\2018\notesparser
                        \beg-python-master.zip\beg-python-master
                        \978-1-59059-982-2\Chapter20\
        -   According to the book, I run this at the command line with
                D:\...> python markup.py < test_input.txt > test_output.html
            IT WORKS!!
